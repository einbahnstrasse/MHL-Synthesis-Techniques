### Deadline: Week 7: {{ site.week-07 }}  

### 1. Watch the Video  

_Enable German subtitles if it would help._   

**Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007)** was an author of fiction with an engineering background, who thought **mathematically about the form** of his stories, which include notable works such as **_Slauterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, A Man Without a Country,_** and other novels.

> "Well, there's no reason why **the simple shapes of stories** can't be fed into computers. They have beautiful shapes. [...] It's the **shape** of the curves that matter and **not their origins**." —Kurt Vonnegut  

### 2. Study the Patch

<!-- [Download this boiler patch here.](/MHL-Synthesis-Techniques/assets/patches/vonnegut.story.shapes.v01.maxpat){:target="_blank"}   -->

### 3. Create a Small Étude   

* Use the `multislider` object to recreate Kurt Vonnegut's story curves, or make your own.   
* Transform, scale, or re-calculate things based on your curve's points by any means.   
* Recall from our lessons how we generated bach lists of `onsets`, `cents`, `durations`, and `velocities`.  
* Map your data to pitches and rhythms in some way, however you like, and send it to `bach.roll`.  
* Play your sequence using `bach.ezmidiplay`. Make changes and adjust your algorithm to "personalize" it and obtain something you like!    

_Be prepared to share your bach sequence and patch in class in Week 7!_
