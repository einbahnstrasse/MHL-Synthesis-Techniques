In our **Discord** channel `#synthesis-techniques`, **post some of your own observations** about this music.  

Write **2-5 sentences reflecting on how you hear** this music, or more if you want. 

You can **write in any language**: German, English, Italian, Russian, or whatever we can translate! 

Be encouraged to constructively **respond to your classmates**: Do you agree or disagree with someone else's post? Were you thinking the same thing? 

If you need help getting started, feel free to use any of these questions below to inspire your response to this music:  

* How does this music reflect the synthesis techniques we have learned each week?   
* Are there sounds that interest you? 
* Are there sounds that repell you? 
* Do you have a favorite or least favorite piece?  
* Do you know these composers? If so, how are these pieces similar to (or different from) the pieces you already know? 
* Have any of these pieces changed your listening habits, or have they changed your awareness about what you are hearing? 

You are certainly welcome to **ask a question** about something you hear or would like to know more about. You can also respond to questions posed by others.  

Please post your reflections/observations before we begin class next week (Week 6).
