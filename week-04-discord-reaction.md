## Deadline: Week 5: {{ site.week-05 }}  

By now, you have listened to our Listening Excerpts for for the first 4 weeks of class:  

* [Week 1 Listening](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/MHL-Synthesis-Techniques/schedule/#listening){:target="_blank"}     
* [Week 2 Listening](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/MHL-Synthesis-Techniques/schedule/#listening-1){:target="_blank"}     
* [Week 3 Listening](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/MHL-Synthesis-Techniques/schedule/#listening-2){:target="_blank"}     
* [Week 4 Listening](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/MHL-Synthesis-Techniques/schedule/#listening-3){:target="_blank"}     

Before class starts next week, Week 5, **post a message on Discord** describing your reactions to the music we have heard so far.   

Post in our Discord channel, `#synthesis-techniques`.  

Your post can be in **any language**. If you prefer to write in German, Italian, Greek, no problem — it's the 21st century and we have translators to help us! 

You only have to write a few sentences... 

If you are not sure what to write, consider the following questions:  

* How do these synthesis techniques **sound different** from one another?   
* Which is your _favorite_ **musical example**, so far?  
* Or, which do you _hate_ the most?  
* Do you know any of these **composers**? If so, how do these pieces differ from _their other_ pieces of music?  
* How might their music relate to the **patches we are building** in class?   

You can also respond to posts made by others:

* Do you **agree** with someone else's post?
* Do you **disagree**?  

Thanks in advance for taking part in our seminar's discourse!
