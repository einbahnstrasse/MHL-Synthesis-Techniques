<h2 id="2-course-description">2. Course Description</h2>

<p><strong>Sound Synthesis Techniques and Creative Coding</strong> is an introductory, first-semester MaxMSP course and creation lab designed for student musicians (without a background in coding) who are interested in the manipulation of sound and music. MaxMSP is a visual programming environment optimized for creative coding and the generation of sound and video signals. With a focus on the musical materials for composition, improvisation, and performance, students will complete their own small projects by the end of the semester with the aid of weekly topics modules and occasional assignments that focuses on understanding a variety of different kinds of synthesis methods used in the twentieth century. Topics may include: basic waveforms and filters; wavetables; amplitude, frequency, and ring modulation; additive and subtractive synthesis; sampling; microsound (granulation); audio spatialization; and the design of practical performance interfaces, monophonic and polyphonic synthesizers. Weekly group coding in MaxMSP will deepen understanding of each topic area, supported by occasional video tutorials and listening. Projects will be evaluated based on creative and personal implementations of synthesis techniques. Although no formal prerequisite exists for this course, prior completion of Electronic Studio Methods and Composition is generally advised. Taught by Dr. Louis Goldford and offered in English.</p>

<h3 id="21-course-goals">2.1 Course Goals</h3>

<p>Students will learn to <strong>integrate</strong> basic formal methods of musical generation into their already established personal and foundational MaxMSP workflow by <strong>building control structures</strong> such as loops, functions, and conditionals. Various data clases, as well as historic approaches to CAO methods by twentieth and twenty-first century composers, will be <strong>observed</strong> and <strong>understood</strong>. A final step in this process is the <strong>creation of a concert work</strong> or a <em>work-in-progress</em> to be presented near the end of the semester during a class concert.</p>

<h3 id="22-learning-outcomes">2.2 Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p><em>By the end of the course, successful students will be able to do the following:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>implement</strong> and <strong>demonstrate</strong> the tools of computer-assisted composition within an artistic workflow</li>
  <li><strong>classify</strong> and <strong>identify</strong> a variety of synthesis methods</li>
  <li><strong>design</strong> compositional algorithms and <strong>apply</strong> them to the control of synthesizers</li>
  <li><strong>identify</strong>, <strong>critique</strong>, and <strong>experiment</strong> with differing approaches to sound synthesis</li>
  <li><strong>compare</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong> real-time and offline computer-assisted methodologies</li>
  <li><strong>assemble</strong> favored tools into a personal creative coding practice, including a logical debugging process</li>
  <li><strong>submit</strong> and <strong>version</strong> assignments through <em>GitHub</em></li>
</ol>

</ol>

<h2 id="3-expectations">3. Expectations</h2>

<h3 id="31-general-expectations">3.1 General Expectations</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Arrive on time</strong> to all course sessions.</li>
  <li>Setup + maintain a public <em>GitHub</em> account, and report your username to the instructor for grading at the start of the semester.</li>
  <li>Spend <strong>1-2 additional hours a week</strong> <em>(outside of class)</em> on the timely completion of our lab assignments and projects.</li>
  <li>Submit assignments by the given deadlines: Unless otherwise noted, assignments are always due online on GitHub at 11:59 PM the following Monday night each week!</li>
  <li><strong>Back up and organize your work REGULARLY on <em>GitHub</em>.</strong> <em>Catastrophic loss of materials is not an excuse for missed deadlines!</em></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="32-weekly-preparation">3.2 Weekly Preparation</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Study video tutorials, slides, and other assigned materials ahead of class.</strong> Come prepared with questions if you don’t understand them.</li>
  <li>We will devote the majority of our class time to patching and creating, and therefore <strong>we will be unable to present videos and slides in class.</strong> Familiarize yourself with this background content beforehand so that you are not lost if we do not address it directly in our class session.</li>
  <li>Additionally, you are strongly encouraged to <strong>consult the recommended software documentation resources</strong>. These provide context and will deepen your understanding as you build your own systems and creative tools.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="33-communication">3.3 Communication</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Weekly class sessions will be held in the 2.43 Electronic Music Studio. Questions can easily be addressed before and after, if not during, our class.</li>
  <li>MHL email accounts are our official means of communication, but we will also use Discord for additional discussion.</li>
  <li><strong>Requests for assistance:</strong> Send an email, or a message on Discord. I will respond during normal working hours; requests arriving “after hours” will be answered on subsequent weekdays.</li>
  <li>Discord should be used during regular hours. Please respond during the workday as promptly as you can to inquiries from the instructor (both for email and messages sent on Discord). <em>Multiple successive days without a response is unacceptable.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Actively participate</strong> in our online class discussions. <strong>Thoughtfully contribute to a positive classroom environment,</strong> while supporting and challenging your colleagues’ ideas.</li>
  <li><strong>Check Discord regularly</strong> for group and private messages.</li>
  <li>If you have a question that may be relevant to the group (about assignments, etc.), post it on Discord.</li>
  <li>Use Discord for easy communication with your colleagues as well — you can DM individuals or selected groups.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="34-self-guided-patching">3.4 Self-Guided Patching</h3>

<ol>
  <li>All students are responsible for building each of our pedagogical patches <strong>by themselves</strong>, regardless of whether a student needs to be absent or late from any class session, for any reason.</li>
  <li>This policy fosters a habit of <strong>personal practice</strong> in Max and <strong>promotes self-guided learning</strong> and <strong>understanding</strong> of each patch’s raw components.</li>
  <li>Students are also responsbile for producing their <strong>own work</strong> throughout the class, including their own builds of our pedagogical patches, in accordance with our <a href="#academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</a> below.</li>
  <li>Direct copies or clones of Max patches are evident in their line-by-line code, and are therefore easily traceable.</li>
  <li>Students should rely on our <strong>seminar discussions</strong>, <strong>patch comments</strong>, <strong>office hours</strong>, Max’s extensive <strong>documentation</strong>, <strong>help files</strong>, and <strong>user forums</strong> to actively troublehsoot and <strong>debug</strong> issues that are naturally expected to arise during patching/coding. <em>This is how one learns best as they engage in project work.</em></li>
  <li>By adopting this policy, we avoid fostering a habit of <strong>relying on others’ code</strong>: that is, constantly borrowing Max patches from colleagues or forums without learning to understand a patch’s underlying functionality.</li>
  <li>This policy is <strong>not to enforce copying or mimicking</strong>, but rather to promote <strong>reasoning through the pedagogical patches</strong> and adopting their utilization <strong>as templates and boiler documents</strong>, that is, as a basis for future work, aimed at <strong>building independence and creativity</strong>. At its core, this policy, therefore, combats the habit of <strong>copying code</strong> without understanding its functioning.</li>
  <li>At first, students may <strong>progress slowly</strong> through this process. However, just like learning to drive a car, students will become more efficient and quicker over time as they <strong>optimize their patching routine</strong> and <strong>build resourcefulness</strong>. Through our class patches and projects, students <strong>will learn to debug faster</strong>, to actively seek solutions from the best resources for any given necessity, and to find resolution in an efficient, self-guided manner.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="35-attendance--participation-policy">3.5 Attendance + Participation Policy</h3>

<p><em>Participation is based on attendance and your engagement in class, and will form a substantial portion of your grade.</em></p>

<h4 id="351-prompt-arrival">3.5.1 Prompt Arrival</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Students are expected to arrive promptly to all class sessions and remain engaged throughout.</li>
  <li>On-time arrivals earn you an immediate 5 points (full participation).</li>
  <li>Arrivals after 14:30 trigger the following weighted score system:</li>

<h4 id="352-absences">3.5.2 Absences</h4>

<h5 id="3521-procedure-for-absences">3.5.2.1 Procedure for Absences</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Students are responsible for completing the same work outside of class that was assigned or completed in class.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you must be absent for any reason, regardless of whether that absence is excused or unexcused, follow this <strong>Procedure for Absences:</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Check our <a href="/schedule" target="_blank">Schedule</a> for assignments, videos, slides, readings, etc.</li>
      <li>Contact a classmate for <strong>patch screenshots</strong> and <strong>notes</strong> on what you missed (e.g. on Discord) <em>(in accordance with <a href="#3523-sharing-patch-screenshots">3.5.2.3 Sharing Patch Screenshots</a> below).</em></li>
      <li>After these first 2 steps, contact the instructor with any additional questions.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Absences/tardiness must be accompanied by documentation</strong> and/or include advance notice with the instructor. Absences/tardiness will not impact on your grade if they are reported in advance and if they are infrequent. Absences will be excused in cases of: documentation of illness provided by a doctor’s note, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (always with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events, at the discretion of the instructor.</li>
  <li><em>A lack of communication with the instructor about planned absences will therefore be treated as <strong>unexcused</strong>. Be in touch early.</em></li>
  <li>Planned absences should be reported to the instructor by our Week 3 class <em>(see our <a href="/schedule" target="_blank">Schedule</a> page).</em></li>
  <li><strong>Absences and lateness may result in a lack of understanding of our materials, which will become evident in your project and/or exam work, and therefore will result in lower exam and project scores.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="3522-required-check-in-meetings">3.5.2.2 Required Check-In Meetings</h5>

<ul>
  <li>A student absent for <strong>a single seminar</strong> need only follow the <a href="#3521-procedure-for-absences">Procedure for Absenses</a> outlined above.</li>
  <li>A student missing <strong>2 seminars</strong> must additionally <strong>schedule a half-hour office hour appointment</strong>, designated as a <strong>Check-In Meeting</strong>, according to instructor availability outlined in <a href="#1-essential-contact-information">Essential Contact Information</a> above.</li>
  <li>Check-In Meetings are necessary to ensure understanding of our course content and to plan alternative work for missed class time.</li>
  <li><strong>Every 2 absences will require a new Check-In Meeting</strong>.</li>
  <li><span style="color: red;"><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Instructor availability is limited and available on a first-come-first-serve basis. I will not always be available due to my additional teaching and other events. Availability for Check-In Meetings, therefore, <strong>is not guaranteed!</strong> Students must coordinate around the instructor’s availability if they choose to be absent from multiple seminars. Failure to scheudle or attend the required number of Check-In Meetings is  firmly the responsibility of the student and will result in lowered participation grades for the semester.</em></span></li>
  <li>Students should, therefore, strive to attend all seminars, or as many as possible, in person.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="3523-sharing-patch-screenshots">3.5.2.3 Sharing Patch Screenshots</h5>

<ol>
  <li>In accordance with <a href="#34-self-guided-patching">3.4 Self-Guided Patching</a> above, students should <strong>never share their patches</strong> (.maxpat) with one another.</li>
  <li>Rather, students should <strong>only share screenshots</strong> of their work. In other words, all students should build each of the pedagogical patches by themselves.</li>
  <li>See <a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laptops/features/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-mac-and-pc" target="_blank">How to take a screenshot on a Mac or PC</a> for further details.</li>

<h3 id="51-general-notes-on-academic-integrity">5.1 General Notes on Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the university recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited at Musikhochschule Lübeck (MHL) and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion.</p>

<!-- The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalog. -->

<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>Instructor Note:</strong> <em>Code borrowed from another source must be attributed as a comment within your own code. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with the instructor before submitting. Where applicable and where marked within our course materials, follow the provisions of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</a></em></span></p>

<h3 id="52-academic-integrity-pledge">5.2 Academic Integrity Pledge</h3>

<p><em>By enrolling in this course, you pledge to uphold the policy on Academic Integrity described below:</em></p>

<p>I understand the value of personal integrity and ethical behavior in all aspects of my professional and personal life. By committing to honesty and personal responsibility, I earn the respect and trust of others. As a student at Musikhochschule Lübeck (MHL), I recognize that the value of my education is not just being able to say I am a college graduate, but it also incorporates the skills, values, and knowledge I have acquired. I thus commit myself to upholding academic integrity as an important aspect of my personal integrity and professional growth. I understand that academic integrity includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fully observing the rules governing exams and assignments regarding resource material, electronic aids, copying, collaborating with others, or engaging in any other behavior that subverts the purpose of the exam or assignment, and the directions of the instructor.</li>
  <li>Only turning in work that I have done myself, and not using unattributed work done by others. While working and studying with others can be an effective way to learn, submitted work will be my own.</li>
  <li>Giving full and proper credit to sources and references, and acknowledging the contributions and ideas of others, in my academic work.</li>
</ol>

<!-- Further, I have read and understand the college’s [Academic Integrity Policy found in the New York City College of Technology College Catalog, p. 56 of the spring 2020 catalog.](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/catalog/docs/catalog.pdf#page=56){:target="_blank"}   -->

<h2 id="8-inclusivity">8. Inclusivity</h2>

<h3 id="81-name-and-pronoun-usage">8.1 Name and Pronoun Usage</h3>

<p>This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.</p>

<h3 id="82-inclusivity-statement">8.2 Inclusivity Statement</h3>

<p><em>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas.</em></p>
